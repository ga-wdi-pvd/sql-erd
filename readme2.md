# Domain Modeling & ERD

## Learning Objectives

-   Draw an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using proper notation
-   Identify and diagram a one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationship between data entities (physical/virtual)
-   Distinguish between entities & attributes (and when you should use one over the other)
-   Discuss data normalization needs and techniques

## Framing

Let's talk relationships

-   No, not your Facebook status.
-   Let's think about ownership or... sharing.
-   People can have one thing... such as a home, or a car.
-   People can also have many things... such as pets, friends,  or books.
-   Things can be owned by people as well, right?
-   Let's remove the word 'owned' and now think of it as a relationship.

Relationship Statuses

-   One to One
-   One to Many
-   Many to Many

Can you think of some examples for each type?

#### We Do: Library ERD Example

As a class, let's come up with an example ERD for an application that manages
a library.

  Today, we identified relationships and Domain / Domain Model.  The Domain Model specifies the data and the relationships between the data.

### Data vs Behavior

-   When problem modeling, we often think of things in terms of nouns and verbs
-   The verbs can be completely captured in code, and since code is saved, they are saved
-   The nouns are represented with placeholders in code (objects, variables, etc)
-   The actual data attached to nouns needs to be persisted! Eg. Game scores, the To-Do list, student list

#### Domain Modeling

-   Attributes only, not behavior.
-   A domain model in problem solving and software engineering is a conceptual model of all the items/topics related to a specific problem.
-   It describes the various entities, their attributes, roles, and relationships,plus the constraints that govern the problem domain.
-   __It does not describe solutions to the problem.__

#### ERDs

-   An ERD is a tool we use to visualize and describe the data relating to the major entities that will exist in our programs.
-   Ultimately lends itself to planning out and creating our database table structure.
-   We keep our data separate from our behavior.
-   There are multiple syntaxes or schemas for diagramming this data.  Here's a diagram for an orchard, generated by the `rails-erd` gem.

-   The squares represent our entities and are filled with the attributes associated with our entity.
-   The arrows between the squares indicate how the entities relate to one another.
    -   There are several types of relationships:
    -   One-to-many: An Company has many Orchards
    -   Many-to-many: An Orchard has many PickingRobots and a PickingRobot works in many Orchards
    -   Requires a join table.
    -   One-to-one: A User has one Profile
    -   Usually denotes that one entity should be an attribute of the other
    -   Usually separated for physical space considerations


#### ERD Lab

Lab time! Let's break up into groups of four. We're going to discuss and build ERDs for popular website.

Each group will be chosen to present one website on their board towards the end of this lab.
